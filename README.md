# RESTful-Wiki-API
This is a Wikipedia like site I developed with Express.js, using MongoDB as my DataBase, Mongoose, and JavaScript.
I created the following API routes:

A GET request at "/articles" route to get all articles.
A POST request at "/articles" route to add a new article.
A DELETE request at "/articles" route to delete all articles.
A GET request at "/articles/articleTitle" route to get a particular article.
A PUT request at "/articles/articleTitle" route to update a particular article.
A PATCH request at "/articles/articleTitle" route to update a particular article.
A DELETE request at "/articles/articleTitle" route to delete a particular article.

Will soon use React as my frontend and update this project.
